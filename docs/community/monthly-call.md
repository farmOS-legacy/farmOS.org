# Monthly Call

The farmOS community hosts a monthly call via [Zoom]. Anyone is welcome to join.
Ask questions, brainstorm ideas, or just talk farming.

**NOTE:** In case you have problems joining a call, check the Riot.im [chat room].
Last minute updates or changes will be communicated there!

## [Join Call]

Calls are currently held on the second Wednesday of the month, at 2pm Eastern
US time.

Note that Daylight Savings Time is observed in the US, so the time relative to
UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) will change twice a year. The schedule below
shows that, along with the actual UTC times for each call. UTC is for most
purposes the same as GMT.
