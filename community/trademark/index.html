<p>This document, the "Policy," outlines the farmOS project's (the "Project")
policy for the use of our trademarks. While our software is available under a
free and open source software license, the copyright license does not include an
implied right or license to use our trademark.</p>
<p>The role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the quality of the products
or services with which the trademark is associated. But because an open source
license allows your unrestricted modification of the copyrighted software, we
cannot be sure that your modifications to the software are ones that will not be
misleading if distributed under the same name. Instead, this Policy describes
the circumstances under which you may use our trademarks.</p>
<p>In this Policy we are not trying to limit the lawful use of our trademarks, but
rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be.
Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we hope to provide enough clarity for you to
understand whether we will consider your use licensed or non-infringing.</p>
<p>The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as
well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission
from us. If you want to use our trademarks in ways that are not described in
this Policy, please see "Where to get further information" below for contact
information. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have
not separately provided written permission is not a use that we have approved,

<p>We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the community,
but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a
source and quality indicator for our software and the associated goods and
services and continue to embody the high reputation of the software and the
community associated with it. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper
balance between: 1) our need to ensure that our trademarks remain reliable
indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve and 2) our community
members' desire to be full participants in the Project.</p>

<p>This Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word Marks,
Logos or Trade Dress, which are collectively referred to as the “Marks.” Some
Marks may not be registered, but registration does not equal ownership of
trademarks. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not.</p>
<h2 id="universal-considerations-for-all-uses">Universal considerations for all uses<a class="headerlink" href="#universal-considerations-for-all-uses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not
mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are
getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways
described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a "likelihood of
confusion" but allows for "nominative use." For example, you cannot say you are
distributing the farmOS software when you're distributing a modified version of
it, because people would be confused when they are not getting the same features
and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from
us. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that
your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. You can,
though, say you like the farmOS software, that you participate in the farmOS
community, that you are providing an unmodified version of the farmOS software,
or that you wrote a book describing how to use the farmOS software.</p>
<p>This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are
getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve
as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of
software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright license for the
software.</li>
<li>You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own
trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or
service name.</li>
<li>Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too
similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our
Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or
abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service. We would consider
the following too similar to one of our Marks:<ul>
<li>Any mark beginning or ending with the letters FARMOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any
goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.</p>

<p>When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software, you are not changing
the quality or nature of it. Therefore, you may retain the Word Marks and the
Logos we have placed on the software to identify your redistribution -- whether
that redistribution is made by optical media, memory stick or download of
unmodified source and executable code. This kind of use only applied if you are
redistributing an official distribution from this Project that has not been
changed in any way. You can find files for the Logos and approved designs for
packaging on farmOS.org.</p>

<p>You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the origin
of the software that you are providing, that is, that the code you are
distributing is a modification of our software. You may say, for example, that
"this software is derived from the source code for farmOS software."</p>
<p>You will need to remove the Logo data files.</p>
<p>Of course, you can place your own trademarks or logos on versions of the
software to which you have made substantive modifications, because by modifying
the software you have become the origin of that exact version. In that case, you
should not use our Logos.</p>

<p>You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the
relationship between your software and ours. Our Mark should be used after a
verb or preposition that describes the relationship between your software and
ours. So you may say, for example, "Bob's software for the farmOS platform" but
may not say "Bob's farmOS software." Some other examples that may work for you
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Your software] works with farmOS software</li>
<li>[Your software] uses farmOS software</li>
<li>[Your software] is compatible with farmOS software</li>
<li>[Your software] is powered by farmOS software</li>

<p>You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in themes, personas, or skins for

executable for the Project, and that you do not suggest that the Project is the
source of the hardware device itself but rather than the Marks are for the
software incorporated into the device.</p>

<p>We will likely consider using the Marks in a software distribution that combines
our software with any other software program an infringement of our Marks. We
would consider your software "combined" with ours if you create a single
executable for both software programs, as well as if by installing our software
it automatically installs yours. We would not consider your software "combined"

<h3 id="what-trademark-law-is-about">What trademark law is about<a class="headerlink" href="#what-trademark-law-is-about" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-trademark">What is a trademark?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-trademark" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words,
phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the
goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is the same as a
trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service
rather than a product. "Trade dress" or "get up" refers to the look and feel of
the packaging, which in this context can include the layout, colors, images, and
design choices in a web page. Throughout this Policy, the terms "trademark" and
"mark" refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress.</p>
<p>However, the use of a word is "not as a trademark" when it is used functionally
as part of the software program, for example, in a file, folder, directory, or
path name. Use in this way is not a trademark infringement.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-likelihood-of-confusion">What is "likelihood of confusion"?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-likelihood-of-confusion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>There is trademark infringement if your use of a trademark has created a
"likelihood of confusion." This means using a trademark in a way that will
likely confuse or deceive the relevant consuming public about the source of a
product or service using the mark in question. For example, if the "Foo"
software extension removes all double spaces after periods, but someone else
later creates "Foo" software that adds a third space after periods, consumers
would be confused between the two and the newcomer will likely be a trademark
infringer. As another example, if a company makes "Foobar" software and a third
party offers training called "Foobar Certification," a person is likely to
believe, wrongly, that the certification is being offered by the makers of
Foobar software. The third party has likely misled consumers about the source of
its training and is a trademark infringer.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-nominative-use">What is "nominative" use?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-nominative-use" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So-called "nominative use" (or "nominative fair use"), which is the name of the
doctrine under U.S. trademark law, allows the use of another's trademark where
it is necessary for understanding. Other countries' trademark laws also have
similar provisions. For example, a car repair shop that specializes in a
particular brand of automobile, VW for example, must be allowed to say that they
repair VW cars. Here is what you should consider when deciding whether your use
of a trademark is a nominative fair use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you can identify the product or service in question without using the
trademark;</li>
<li>Whether you are avoiding a likelihood of confusion in the way that you have
used the trademark; and</li>
<li>Whether you have used only as much as is necessary to identify the product or
service.</li>
</ul>
<p>With our "Foobar Certification" example above, the person offering the
certification would be allowed to say, under the nominative fair use doctrine,
that she is offering "Maude's Certification for Foobar software."</p>
<p>It is almost never the case that using a Logo will be a nominative fair use
since it will be a rare case where the logo is needed for strictly informational
purposes.</p>
<h3 id="proper-trademark-use">Proper trademark use<a class="headerlink" href="#proper-trademark-use" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>These rules hold true for all trademarks, not just ours, so you should follow
them for our Marks as well as anyone else's.</p>
<h4 id="use-of-trademarks-in-text">Use of trademarks in text<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-trademarks-in-text" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>Always distinguish trademarks from surrounding text with at least initial
capital letters or in all capital letters.</strong></p>
<p>Note that with the farmOS mark, an exception is made in that the first letter
can be lowercase, but "OS" must be capitalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: farmos</li>
<li>Acceptable: FarmOS, FARMOS, farmOS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling, neither
abbreviated, hyphenated, or combined with any other word or words.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: Farm OS, farm-OS</li>
<li>Acceptable: farmOS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't pluralize a trademark.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: I have seventeen farmOSes running on my farm.</li>
<li>Acceptable: I have seventeen farmOS instances running on my farm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't use "a" or "the" to refer to an instance of the trademark.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: I put a farmOS on my mom's computer.</li>
<li>Acceptable: I put a farmOS instance on my mom's computer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun. You can see the nouns
we prefer under "Our trademarks."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: This is a farmOS. Anyone can install it.</li>
<li>Acceptable: This is a farmOS application. Anyone can install it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't use a trademark as a verb. Trademarks are products or services, never
actions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: I farmOSed my computer today!</li>
<li>Acceptable: I installed farmOS on my computer today!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't use a trademark as a possessive. Instead, the following noun should be
used in possessive form or the sentence reworded so there is no possessive.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unacceptable: farmOS's interface is very clean.</li>
<li>Acceptable: The farmOS dashboard's interface is very clean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't translate a trademark into another language.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acceptable: Quiero instalar farmOS en mi sistema.</li>
<li>Unacceptable: Quiero instalar granjaOS en mi sistema.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="use-of-logos">Use of Logos<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-logos" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You may not change any Logo except to scale it. This means you may not add
decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions, distort it, add
elements, or combine it with other logos.</p>
<p>However, when the context requires the use of black-and-white graphics and the
logo is color, you may reproduce the logo in a manner that produces a
black-and-white image.</p>
